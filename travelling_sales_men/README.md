The algorithm tries to find an optimal cycle in a graph using the Kruskal heuristic. 

The simulation is based on the open source vis.js graph visualization library.
The demo has an interactive web interface to construct a graph and then run the algorithm.

The main algorithm can be found in : js/graph.js
The visualization configuration and other helper function : js/main.js
